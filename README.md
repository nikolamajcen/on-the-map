# On The Map

iOS application written in Swift for showing users on the map. 

This application is using Udacity and Parse API.

## How it works
For login you need to have Udacity account.

After login, you can see:
* Posted locations from all Udacity users
* User list with all users which posted ther location with URL
* Account details

Every user can post his location with an URL, and after that, it can only overwrite existing location and URL.
